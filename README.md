# PL-QA-assignment

## Purpose

This is a personal assignment for the QA Intern Position at PrinterLogic.
This tests the login screen for the PrinterLogic SaaS PrinterCloud.

## Tests created

- Simple login check
- Simple login using the enter (or return) key
- Attempt to log in without a username
- Attempt to log in without a password
- Attempt to log in with bad login information
- Obnoxious clicking of the login button
- Forgot password button
- Forgot password button/login screen obnoxious switch
- Privacy policy clicked
- Failure to log in, then success

## Browsers

These tests will run on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera in that order.

## Going forward

The following are ways I could have continued on.

- Make interactions with the DOM more modular to allow for easier and more customizable scripting.
- Add previous versions of browser drivers to testing.
- Run tests on different operating systems
